    "### Parkinson's Disease\n",
    "Parkinsonâ€™s disease is a chronic degenerative disorder of the central nervous system that affects mobility and movement in ageing population; it is classified as a movement disorder. Symptoms of PD starts gradually progressive damage of dopamine generating cells, tremors are common, but the PD disorder causes stiffness or slowness of movement. Other than these impaired posture or balance, loss of automatic movements, speech changes, writing changes are more common. PD symptoms are worsening as condition progresses overtime. There is no proven evidence to get cured PD, but medicine might improvise your symptoms and if needed doctor may suggest surgery on rare occasions to regulate the brain and improvise your symptoms.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Diagnostics by voice\n",
    "\n",
    "The assessment of PD is involves various empirical tests to be performed on the current diagnosis protocol including Physical, Speech and voice tests etc. Noninvasive telemonitoring is a latest trending in general medical care in terms of reliable, cost effective method to decrease the cost and increase the accuracy of the clinical evaluation. \n",
    "\n",
    "So there is a high potential for telemonitoring of PD is significantly depend on designing of simple test that can self administered easily and remotely. For these type of Non invasive test there is less human support required, since the recording the voice is non invasive can be readily integrate with ehealth applications. The use of vowel phonations to assess the extent of vocal symptoms where is the subjects requested to hold the frequency of phonation of as long as possible, so the recorded voice signals will assess by the speech algorithms."
