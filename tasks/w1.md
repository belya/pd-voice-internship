This week I expect you to achieve the understanding of the suggested task.  I.e. to do the following:
1. Download the dataset. Make sure that you are able to process given csv file
2. Describe the target variable. What is UPDRS score? In what way and how ofter was it measured? What is the difference between total_UPDRS and motor_UPDRS?
3. Describe the process of feature extraction. In what way and how ofter were they measured? What are the significant features for classification task? 
4. Describe the difference between UPDRS regression and simple classification task. Is there a difference between predicting PD diagnosis on early stages and predicting changes on the last stages of the disease? If yes, what is the difficulty?

The information about data extraction process is situated on pages 3-4 of the suggested paper. The analysis of the features can be found on a page 7 of the paper and in the attached notebook. I want to share some thoughts and papers about 4th question later, but please think about it as well.
