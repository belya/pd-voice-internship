The goal of PD subproject is to find out is the given dataset applicable to solve the problem mentioned by research authors, i.e. "to estimate UPDRS score using features related to the voice records made by PD patients".  

It is important to note the answer for q4 from w1. Authors have reported overestimated model quality because of no constraints for train/test split. We've checked that the dataset contains multiple records for each subject, and, if the validation set is generated in such way that there is no intersection between subjects on test and train, then the models suggested by authors overfit a lot. It is not possible to use such models to estimate UPDRS score for the new patients.

Please look at the description.ipynb file. There is a bunch of features mentioned to be significant for the healthy subject/PD patient classification problem. The task for this week is to check the significance (or insignificance) of interconnection between the given features and UPDRS score transformations listed below. 

Let's split our work in the following manner:

- Lakshmi - transformation 1
- Nilakshi - transformation 2
- Santhosh - transformation 3

To achieve proposed goal, you should use statistical tests to show that the result of your investigation is not accidental, i.e. significant. But any additional materials as explanatory models and visualizations are welcome.
